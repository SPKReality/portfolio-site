  Making websites is all about creating and designing web pages that people can see on the internet. In this unit, we’ll learn how to build websites from scratch. Students will find out about the different parts of a website, like how to set up the structure, make it look good, and add cool things like pictures or buttons. They’ll also get to make their own simple websites to practice what they’ve learned. By the end of this unit, students will know how to make basic websites and understand the main ideas behind building them.
