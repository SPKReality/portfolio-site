# Different Types of Formulas used within my work
## VLOOKUP Formula
> The VLOOKUP formula is used to extract data from other tables based on a users input field or form input. Within my work ive included this many times for things such as getting a Shoe size from UK, EU & USA from one input e.g. if a user inputted there shoe size in the UK field it would autofill the USA & EU based on the table. This was also include in my Assignment Two, this assignment is all about creating a Spreadsheet for a Football Game so that they can keep track of ticket sales, seats avaliable and customer data, Within this i used VLOOKUP to assign tickets to users based on age. An example of this is if a child was 2 years old they would be automatically assigned a infant ticket which would be free. However if the person was 60+ they would be assigned a ticket named "Senior" which would be £145, plus there seating area.

## Data Validation
> Data Validation was implemented into all of the spreadsheets i have created, including the Football Seasonal Tickets Sheet. Validation is important beacuse it avoids human errors that could possibly cause the company issues. Validation for the Football Seasonal Tickets Sheet was used to ensure that Phone numbers, Emails and Addresses are correctly inputted so that the Customer can be contacted and stored for further actions or for further purchases.

## Conditional Formatting 
> Conditional Formatting  is important as it allows people to visaully see the data in a form off colour coding. Within the Football Seasonal Tickets Sheet Conditional Formatting was used to show the price of a ticket, Red if £0, Orange if £10-100, Red if £100+.

## Charts
> Charts are a important factor of spreadsheets because of there simplicity but appealing look, they are the key to easy an Summary as they show all relevant data needed in one easy to read chat.
