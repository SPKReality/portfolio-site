  Databases are essential for storing, organizing, and managing large amounts of information in a structured way. In this unit, we will learn the basics of database development. Students will discover how to create, maintain, and use databases to store data efficiently. We will explore key concepts such as tables, records, and fields, as well as how to run simple queries to find specific information. By the end of this unit, students will have the skills to build and use databases, which are important tools for many jobs and everyday tasks.
